# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data to explore trends, patterns, and important insights related to the spread of the virus globally. The analysis is performed using SQL queries to extract, transform, and generate insights from the dataset, which is then visualized using tools like Power BI.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to track and analyze COVID-19 data using SQL-based analysis. The dataset contains information about confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across various regions and countries. The project aims to provide insights into the progression of the pandemic, identify hotspots, and highlight trends over time.

## Key Metrics:
- **Total Confirmed Cases:** The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **Total Deaths:** The total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.
- **Total Recovered:** The number of recoveries from COVID-19.
- **Active Cases:** Calculated by subtracting deaths and recoveries from the total confirmed cases.
- **Country-wise and Date-wise Analysis:** Track the spread of COVID-19 across different countries and time periods.
